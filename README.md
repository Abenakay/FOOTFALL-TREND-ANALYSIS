### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial preparation phase, i performed the following tasks:ecommendations
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the trend data to answer keys questions such as:

- What is the overall footfall trend?
- Which entry points are the most used?
- What are th epeak foot count period?

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis , i recommend:
- Implement targeted marketing campaigns during low footfall periods to drive visitor traffic and increase tenant occupancy.

Explanation: The footfall report indicates specific periods with lower footfall within the mall. To optimize tenant occupancy and overall mall performance, it is recommended to implement targeted marketing campaigns during these low footfall periods. By strategically planning promotions, events, or discounts during these times, the landlord can attract more visitors and potentially increase sales for tenants.

- Enhance the mall's visitor experience by optimizing the layout and tenant mix to align with high footfall areas.

Explanation: The footfall report provides insights into popular sections or zones within the mall that attract higher footfall. By optimizing the mall's layout and tenant mix in alignment with these high footfall areas, the landlord can enhance the visitor experience, increase engagement, and drive more foot traffic throughout the mall.

- Conduct surveys at the mall to gather demographic Insights into the mall traffic:

Explanation: Optional surveys to collect data on age, gender distribution, collect data on suggestions or customer interest, complaint, visitor origin , etc. will help the landlord have a better sense of the target market, give insights as to which marketing platforms will be best, and what tenant mix will be favorable. It will also inform he team about the repeat visitors and place of origin which will aid in strategic planning of the mall layout and campaigns

- Collect foot traffic data from each tenant and analyze it in relation to their sales:

Explanation: The mall's ability to effectively convert footfall into sales is of utmost importance. Currently, we gather data on turnover and footfall separately. To bridge these two types of data, I recommend collecting information on the number of customers visiting each shop on a monthly basis. This will enable us to gain insights into the conversion rates and present a more comprehensive picture of sales versus turnover.

- By requesting the total customer numbers per shop in relation to the turnover figures, we can calculate the conversion rates and understand how effectively footfall is translating into actual sales. This information will provide valuable insights into the performance of individual shops and the mall as a whole.

- Moreover, analyzing the relationship between customer numbers and turnover will help us identify any discrepancies or areas for improvement. It will enable us to identify shops with high footfall but low sales, indicating potential issues in conversion strategies or customer experiences. Conversely, shops with high sales despite lower footfall may highlight effective sales techniques or exceptional customer service.

- By integrating customer numbers with turnover data, we will gain a more accurate and holistic understanding of the mall's performance in converting footfall into sales. This will support informed decision-making, allowing us to devise strategies to enhance conversion rates, optimize tenant selection, and ultimately improve the mall's overall sales performance.

### Limitations
